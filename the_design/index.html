            Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I
            could improve my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted
            to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on
            paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some
            challenge, something that makes more sense with what I thought. I
            saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user
            interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that the
            result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.

          <h4>Start with asking why</h4>
          <p>
            You will start seeing things differently and coming up with more
            effective ways of achieving goals.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Your ideas will have more value</h4>
          <p>
            By looking at problems from a different perspective, your ideas will
            be fresher and more valuable.

        <div>
          <h4>Design solutions with love</h4>
          <p>
            Only when you experience a problem yourself do you understand the
            frustration of the users and resolve to end it.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Share and show your work</h4>
          <p>
            As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not
            finished or doesn’t look perfect. You will learn to accept feedback
            and learn from it.

        <h3>Are you ready? Let’s go!!</h3>
        <p>
          The challenge lasts 30 days. On each of those days you will have to
          create a solution to any problem you yourself are facing and show the
          result to the community.

          <p>It has to be a problem that’s personally affecting or affected you, like finding your keys, calling
            a taxi or even remembering something. Open your eyes, look around you carefully and pay
